# contactForm
A contact form for publishing on a website. A Lambda function is used to implement the backend logic which communicates with an SNS topic to which an email address is subscribed to be notified via email when a user fills out the form. Both the frontend code and the NodeJS Lambda function code can be found in this repository.
